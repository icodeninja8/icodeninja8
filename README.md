## Summary

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Chief Technology Officer Â· Senior AI Principal Engineer |
| **Experience** | 10+ years software engineering Â· 8+ years technical leadership |
| **Core Focus** | Multi-agent systems, RAG pipelines, secure/compliant AI for regulated domains |

## About

I design, build, and ship scalable AI platforms â€” specializing in multi-agent orchestration (LangChain, LangGraph), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and compliant data pipelines (HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP). I lead cross-functional teams from prototype â†’ production and focus on observability, cost/latency optimization, and audit-ready architecture.

## Core strengths

| Capability | Tools & Notes |
|---|---|
| Multi-Agent Systems & Orchestration | LangChain, LangGraph â€” agent routing, tool wrappers, memory modules |
| RAG & Vector Search | Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB, Redis â€” embedding strategies, index design |
| LLM Engineering | GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, Hugging Face â€” model routing, prompt engineering |
| MLOps & Serving | FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, Ray Serve, MLflow â€” autoscaling & CI/CD |
| Security & Compliance | HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP, NIST â€” secure ingestion, RBAC, audit logging |
| Cloud & Infra | Azure, AWS, GCP â€” cost-optimized deployments, managed services |
